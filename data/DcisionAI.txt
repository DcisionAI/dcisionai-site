DcisionAI is a decision intelligence platform that augments optimization models with agentic AI and real-time data. It connects to internal data lakes and external data sources, retrieving live variables and constraints to dynamically adapt decisions.

Its core architecture includes:
- **Model**: Optimizers (e.g. LP, MILP, heuristics)
- **Context**: Real-time data from customer environments
- **Protocol**: Governed workflows that adapt over time

DcisionAI uses a plug-in system that installs into enterprise environments, avoiding disruptive replatforming. It explains every decision, tracks override history, and supports human-in-the-loop adjustments.

DcisionAI is being co-developed with Dimiour, with use cases across:
1. **Fleet Optimization** (VGO): Dynamic routing, truck capacity planning, shipment bundling
2. **Supply Chain**: SKU transfers across warehouses, stockout reduction, inventory placement
3. **Workforce Planning**: Shift optimization based on demand and skills
4. **Financial Planning**: Budget allocation under constraints

Technical team includes:
- 2 PhD optimization SMEs
- 3 LLM full-stack engineers (via offshore development center with Dimiour)
- MVP architecture includes: plugin manager, control plane, data plane, context engine

Roadmap highlights:
- MVP within 4â€“6 months across 2 Dimiour products
- Series A targeted post first enterprise deployment
- Seed round: $3M to fund 2 years of team + infra + reserve
- Revenue expected from month 12 onward; ARR targets $2M+ by Series A

Differentiators:
- Composable agents and pluggable logic
- Protocol-first architecture (vs. rule engines)
- Embedded explainability and override audit trail
- Human-in-the-loop + autonomous flexibility

Investor positioning:
- Large TAM across SCM, ops, planning, finance
- Fast wedge via Dimiour deployments
- Founder committed with skin-in-the-game and pledge structure

DcisionAI = OpenAI-style decision orchestration for enterprise.

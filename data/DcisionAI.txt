DcisionAI is an agentic AI platform for decision intelligence. It connects enterprise systems with internal data lakes and external variables to optimize decisions using composable agents, protocols, and real-time context.

Core Architecture:
- Model: Optimization models (LP, MILP, heuristics)
- Context: Real-time internal + external data streams
- Protocol: Governed workflows with human-in-the-loop and override traceability

Plugin Architecture:
- Customers install a lightweight plugin
- Connects to ERP, CRM, planning tools
- Pulls variables and constraints in real-time
- Adapts to internal systems without replatforming

MCP (Model, Context, Protocol) is central:
- Model = the optimization logic
- Context = live input variables and enterprise constraints
- Protocol = explainable decision sequence + governance

Key Use Cases:
1. Fleet Optimization (via VGO): routing, truck planning, shipment bundling
2. Workforce Planning: shift allocation, skill coverage, schedule optimization
3. Supply Chain: warehouse transfer, SKU inventory balance, forecast-driven movement
4. Financial Planning: budget allocation under multiple constraint layers

ODC (Offshore Development Center) Setup:
- Partnership with Dimiour to staff a high-quality offshore team
- Core team: 2 PhD optimization scientists + 3 LLM-focused full-stack developers
- All team members are embedded with DcisionAI through Dimiour’s India-based ODC
- ODC handles backend, frontend, LangChain/GPT integration, and deployment pipelines
- Optimized for cost-efficiency and speed without compromising quality
- Positioned as a long-term co-development arm through Series A

Market:
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
  - Global spend on AI-enabled decision optimization, forecasting, planning, and scheduling in enterprise environments exceeds $20B+
  - Includes supply chain AI ($11B+), workforce planning software ($5B+), and financial optimization in enterprise ($3B+)
SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
  - Target industries: manufacturing, logistics, automotive, CPG, retail
  - Serviceable market includes plugin-compatible enterprises with digital operations and data lakes
  - SAM estimate: ~$6B based on verticals addressable through Dimiour-like deployments and plugin architecture

Market Overview (TAM / SAM / SOM / SOR):
- TAM: $20B+ Global spend on AI-enabled decision optimization, forecasting, planning, and scheduling in enterprise environments exceeds $20B+
- SAM: $6B Target industries: manufacturing, logistics, automotive, CPG, retail. Serviceable market includes plugin-compatible enterprises with digital operations and data lakes. SAM estimate: ~$6B based on verticals addressable through Dimiour-like deployments and plugin architecture
- SOM: $2–5M initial ARR with GTM via Dimiour products across 5–7 enterprise customers with Dimiour-enabled upsell motion


- Post-Seed, SOR expands via:
  - Scaled plugin integration teams (ODC + partner-led)
  - Additional vertical-specific use cases and agent modules
  - Onboarding self-serve clients for smaller deployments
- Expansion of SOR is tied to investment in deployment bandwidth and customer onboarding capacity
  - Longer-term SOM: $20–40M in ARR from expanded verticals post-Series A

Business Model:
- SaaS with usage-based pricing
- Enterprise deployment cycle: < 30 days
- Native plugin stack enables quick GTM
- Revenue potential per enterprise: $250K–$500K ARR across multiple decision domains

Development Plan:
- MVP built with ODC engineers across two Dimiour products
- Founder-led product design and GTM strategy
- Use Dimiour as wedge into $2–5M ARR via multi-product deployments

Burn Rate & Ops:
- Lean startup budget at $1M pre-seed covers:
  - SME + Dev costs (~$300k/year)
  - Cloud/infra (~$5–6k/month)
  - Ops overhead (~10%)
  - Reserve runway = 24 months
- Scaling plan includes:
  - Series A at $2M ARR
  - Deployment on 5–7 products via plugin strategy

Investor Narrative:
- Early access to large enterprise accounts via Dimiour
- ROI modeled via wedge-to-expansion plan with high retention
- Product-market fit expected within 9–12 months
- Seed-stage valuation aligned to $8–12M post with rapid scale to Series A

Strategic Differentiators:
- Agentic framework
- Human-in-the-loop governance layer
- Composable agents and protocol registry
- Audit-friendly and explainable optimization

Explainability and Trust:
- Each decision is documented
- Users can override and see why
- Enables decision history + fine-tuning
